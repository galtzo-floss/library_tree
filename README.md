## 🌻 Synopsis

This tool can help library maintainers earn money from their open source work in one line of code.

👉️ No network calls.
👉️ No tracking.
👉️ No oversight.
👉️ Minimal crypto hashing.
💡 Easily disabled by `ENV['FLOSS_FUNDING_SILENT'] = "CATHEDRAL_OR_BAZAAR"`

Now, back to the one line of code I mentioned. If you blink you may miss it...

```ruby
module MyGemLibrary
  include LibraryTree::Poke.new(__FILE__) # <====== THERE IT IS! ONE LINE OF CODE!
end
```

The website that will generate activation keys for your gems is coming soon @ [floss-funding.dev](https://floss-funding.dev).  FLOSS Funding relies on empathy, respect, honor, and annoyance of the most extreme mildness.  It doesn't accept payments for activation keys, and trusts you to go and sponsor or donate to your favorite open source projects before getting their "activation key".

What does an _activation key_ do?  It silences the nags for a library, and "activates" your peace of mind. It rewards you with a gold star sticker (⭐️) for each project you fund when your process exits.  That's it.

The project *does not affect* licensing of projects.  It is purely a tool to help library maintainers earn money from their open source work.

This is permitted by nearly all, if not all, FLOSS licenses, including the popular MIT, BSD 2-clause, BSD 3-clause, Apache 2.0, etc.

There are two kinds of "free" in software:

1. Free as in beer
2. Free as in freedom (of speech)

No FLOSS licenses I am aware of guarantee "free as in beer". Since developers deserve to be paid for their work, I decided to make this tool.

It has been my experience that work on the dark underbelly of software, down in the test harnesses, and the dev tools, often gets overlooked, as people focus on the big frameworks.

This tool makes it far easier to get paid for your work down there at the bottom of the stack, in the dev dependencies that get overlooked by most OSS funding tools.

Activation keys use a cipher encryption algorithm against a 2400-word dictionary, with some other data, like the project's namespace, and the current month, thrown in, to make valid activation keys slightly difficult to discover manually. Once a key is made it is valid forever. There is no revocation. The activation keys are _opaque_, rather than _private_. They are not tied to you in any way. Other people may use the same one. And that's fine! They don't do anything except silence some STDOUT nagging.

## TO DO List

Website coming soon.

- [ ] A website to generate activation keys for gems
    - [ ] List all known gems that can be activated with library_tree
    - [ ] Account creation with email address, for those who want to keep a record of their generated activation keys
    - [ ] (Optional) Enter Gem Name
    - [ ] Affirm they have purchased an activation key
    - [ ] (Optional) Receive activation key specific to namespace & month generated
    - [x] Activation key will remain valid for that namespace forever (tested out to the June, 5425 C.E.)

I expect the current release of this gem to be compatible with Ruby 1.8.7+,
but it is only tested on CI against Ruby 2.3+,
due to the inherent limitations of GitHub Actions.

## ✨ Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add library_tree

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install library_tree

### 🔒 Secure Installation

<details>
  <summary>For Medium or High Security Installations</summary>

This gem is cryptographically signed, and has verifiable [SHA-256 and SHA-512][💎SHA_checksums] checksums by
[stone_checksums][💎stone_checksums]. Be sure the gem you install hasn’t been tampered with
by following the instructions below.

Add my public key (if you haven’t already, expires 2045-04-29) as a trusted certificate:

```console
gem cert --add <(curl -Ls https://raw.github.com/galtzo-floss/certs/main/pboling.pem)
```

You only need to do that once.  Then proceed to install with:

```console
gem install library_tree -P HighSecurity
```

The `HighSecurity` trust profile will verify signed gems, and not allow the installation of unsigned dependencies.

If you want to up your security game full-time:

```console
bundle config set --global trust-policy MediumSecurity
```

`MediumSecurity` instead of `HighSecurity` is necessary if not all the gems you use are signed.

NOTE: Be prepared to track down certs for signed gems and add them the same way you added mine.

</details>

## 🔧 Basic Usage

Usage patterns:

1. Traditional namespace (uses the including module's name):
    ```ruby
    module MyGemLibrary
      include LibraryTree::Poke.new(__FILE__)
    end
    ```
2. Arbitrary custom namespace (can add version, or anything else):
    ```ruby
    module MyGemLibrary
      include LibraryTree::Poke.new(__FILE__, namespace: "Custom::Namespace::V4")
    end
    ```

## Configuration

### Silence via lobal Environment Variable

For global silence the best solution is to set the environment variable `FLOSS_FUNDING_SILENT=CATHEDRAL_OR_BAZAAR` before your application starts.

If you can't control ENV variables, and you can control the stack, at the beginning of the stack, before other things load, simply `require "library_tree/silent"`, and it will silence all output. Note that this is less performant than setting the global environment variable, as above.

### Silence via Poke.new `silent` option.

`silent` options values can be any of:

- truthy - indicates that the library including Poke.new requires `LibraryTree` to be silent, perhaps due to scanning the output of a command, or generating output that is expected elsewhere.
- falsey - indicates that the library including Poke.new does not require `LibraryTree` to be silent. This is effectively the default.
- Object that responds to `:call` - indicates that the library including Poke.new might require `LibraryTree` to be silent, and that evaluation will be done whenever LibraryTree attempts to print something.

If you have a library that doesn't know, at the time of `Poke.new` inclusion, if it needs silence, pass an object that responds to `:call` as the `silent` option to `LibraryTree::Poke.new`.

**IMPORTANT** - By the time your `Poke.new` using library loads into a stack, other libraries may have already loaded `Poke.new` for themselves, and may have already generated output. This is not a solution for silencing all output. The main thing it can reliably do is silence the output from the at_exit handler.

If you need to silence **everything**, do so by setting the environment variable `FLOSS_FUNDING_SILENT=CATHEDRAL_OR_BAZAAR` before your application starts.

### File-based Configuration

Gems that use the library_tree gem can configure some features by creating a `.library_tree.yml` file at their root directory. This works in the same manner as `.rubocop.yml` for gems that use RuboCop.

The following options are configured via the `.library_tree.yml` file:

1. `suggested_donation_amount` - The suggested donation amount to display in the begging message (default: 5)
2. `library_tree_url` - The URL to direct users to for donations or sponsorship
   a. default: https://floss-funding.dev, which doesn't take donations on behalf of other projects, but it will have helpful tips on how to find a way to donate.

#### Example Configuration

In your `.library_tree.yml` at the root of your project:

```yaml
suggested_donation_amount: 10
library_tree_url: https://example.com/fund
```

## 📌 Versioning

This Library adheres to [![Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][📌semver-img]][📌semver].
Violations of this scheme should be reported as bugs.
Specifically, if a minor or patch version is released that breaks backward compatibility,
a new version should be immediately released that restores compatibility.
Breaking changes to the public API will only be introduced with new major versions.

### 📌 Is "Platform Support" part of the public API?

Yes.  But I'm obligated to include notes...

SemVer should, but doesn't explicitly, say that dropping support for specific Platforms
is a *breaking change* to an API.
It is obvious to many, but not all, and since the spec is silent, the bike shedding is endless.

> dropping support for a platform is both obviously and objectively a breaking change

- Jordan Harband (@ljharb, maintainer of SemVer) [in SemVer issue 716][📌semver-breaking]

To get a better understanding of how SemVer is intended to work over a project's lifetime,
read this article from the creator of SemVer:

- ["Major Version Numbers are Not Sacred"][📌major-versions-not-sacred]

As a result of this policy, and the interpretive lens used by the maintainer,
you can (and should) specify a dependency on these libraries using
the [Pessimistic Version Constraint][📌pvc] with two digits of precision.

For example:

```ruby
spec.add_dependency("library_tree", "~> 1.0")
```

See [CHANGELOG.md][📌changelog] for a list of releases.
